### Lab 4 Questions - Willa Fouts
## 1. What Licensing Agreement did you choose and why?
# I chose "None" to keep it public, although I could have written in what the guide prompted for my repository, which was Public Domain. 
## 2. What are data archiving options are recommended by the Montana State University Library?
# They recommend using opensource files that are publicly accessible and describing the metadata and data in a way to make it 
# searchable and understandable. Public, trustworthy sites to store data with that are listed are: Zenodo, Dryad, ICPSR, PLOS, 
# Scientific Data, and NIH. 
## 3. How would using GitHub help make your data/code align with FAIR Protocols?
# It would make it findable, i.e. searchable to people or machines. Also, if it is public, anyways, it is accessible. It is up to the 
# user whether the data is in a file format that allows it to be interoperable. The ReadMe file with GitHub encourages the idea of 
# reusability, because a thorough description there would allow and encourage someone to be able to reuse the data should they desire.
## 4. What are the advantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?
# The advantages of making data/code more widely accessible are that people can use your data to make discoveries, they can also cite 
# and check on your work beyond just reading your written publications, and they will be able to find your work when they (or a machine) 
# search for a related topic.
## 5. What are the disadvantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?
# The goal is transparencey, but that also means that people could use your data and notice that you made a mistake.
## 6. What data/code from your grad project would you envision publishing on GitHub?
# I should publish my lab results and statistical code from all aspects of my first chapter. For the second chapter, I should publish 
the code for the statistical analysis.
## 7. What data/code would you not publish? Why?
# I would only not publish really minor components and original datasets. Things that are unnessesary or too messy for someone else to 
# operate can stay with me. More polished and clear datasets and essential code are more what I think I should publish. That being said,
# would include the steps that I took in the spreadsheet to get to the final values that I used for analysis, both for transparency, and
# becasuse someone might be interested in my methodolgy more than my final values.
