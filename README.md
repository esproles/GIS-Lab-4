# This repository is for GIS lab 4 to introtuce us to GitHub, MarkDown, and how to upload data to GitHub. This means we probably have no excuse to not make our thesis data FAIR. The data included is a CSV file with substrate induced respiration proxy measurements of CO2 in parts per million, as per the Fierer methods. The CO2 values are actual and have already been taken from a standard curve of different known CO2 concentrations. The treatments are undefined as yet for this data. T_0, 1, and 2 refer to times zero, one, and two, from which one could graph a line of the increasing CO2/treatment, which will be what I will compare in my thesis.
